Automata.NET can most conveniently be built using Visual Studio 2013 from Main.sln.
All compiled binaries, except for binaries for test projects, 
are placed in the top level bin folder.

The main projects are: Automata, Automata.Z3, Fast, and Bek
that are accompanied by corresponding unit test projects:
Automata.Tests, Automata.Z3.Tests, Fast.Tests, and Bek.Tests

All projects are configured to use .NET Framework Version 4.5.
and require at least version 4.0 (due to dependency on System.Numerics.BigInteger
that is not directly available in earlier versions of .NET)

The core Automata project (/src/Automata/Automata.csproj) 
can be built separately and has no dependencies. 

The Automata.Z3 project depends on Automata and Z3. 
The Z3 x86 binaries: Microsoft.Z3.dll and libz3.dll
must be stored in the folder ext/Z3/release/x86.
The version of Z3 with which the build has been tested
is 4.3.2.0, and can be dowloaded from 
https://github.com/Z3Prover/bin/blob/master/releases/z3-4.3.2-x86-win.zip

The Fast (Functional Abstraction of Symbolic Transductions) project
depends on Automata, Automata.Z3, and Z3. 
Fast language uses a custom parser that is generated with 
Gardens Point Parser Generator version 1.5.0. 
The generated fast-parser is standalone, there is no runtime library dependency.
The tool can be downloaded from http://gppg.codeplex.com/downloads/get/378045
In order to regenerate the fast-parser if modifications are made 
to the /src/Fast/parser/fast.lex or /src/Fast/parser/fast.y files
see the file: /src/Fast/parser/genparser.bat for details.

The Bek project depends on Automata, Automata.Z3, Z3, 
and Antlr34 runtime for the bek-parser and query-parser for bek.
Antlr34 can be installed as a nuget package from 
https://www.nuget.org/packages/Antlr34
Install nuget from: http://docs.nuget.org/consume/installing-nuget.

The runtime library Antlr3.Runtime.dll of Antlr34 must be in
the folder /packages/Antlr34.3.4.19004.1/lib/ that is created automatically 
if the package is installed into the solution using VS 2013
(e.g. rightclick the solution and select 'Manage NuGet Packages for Solution ...')

In order to regenerate the bek-parser or the query-parser if changes are made 
to the bek parser source file /src/Bek/Frontend/ParserImpl/bek.g or
the query parser source file /src/Bek/Query/ParserImpl/query.g
see /src/Bek/Frontend/ParserImpl/generateBekParser.bat 
and /src/Bek/Query/ParserImpl/generateQueryParser.bat
The bat files assume Antlr34 has been installed in /packages/Antlr34.3.4.19004.1
