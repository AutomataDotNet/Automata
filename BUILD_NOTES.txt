Automata.NET can be built using Visual Studio 2013 from Main.sln.
All compiled files are placed in the top level bin folder.

The main projects are: Automata, Automata.Z3, and Fast
that are accompanied by corresponding unit test projects.

All projects use .NET Framework Version 4.5.

Automata can be built first and has no dependencies. 

Automata.Z3 depends on Automata and Z3
- Z3 can be downloaded separately from GitHub or codeplex

The Z3 x86 binaries: Microsoft.Z3.dll, libz3.dll
should be placed in the folder ext/Z3/release/x86

FAST stands for Functional Abstraction of Symbolic Transductions.
Fast project depends on Z3, Automata, and Automata.Z3. 
It uses tree automata and tree transducer algorithms.

Fast uses a custom parser that is generated with 
- Gardens Point LEX 
and 
- Gardens Point Parser Generator
These tools can be downloaded from codeplex in order to regenerate 
the fast parser if modifications are made to the fast.lex or fast.y files.
See the file: src/Fast/parser/genparser.bat for details.
