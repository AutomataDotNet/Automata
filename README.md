# Automata
Automata is a .NET library that provides algorithms for composing and analyzing _regular expressions_, _automata_, and _transducers_. In addition to classical word automata, it also includes algorithms for analysis of _tree automata_ and _tree transducers_. The library covers algorithms over finite alphabets as well as their _symbolic_ counterparts. In symbolic automata concrete characters have been replaced by _character predicates_. Such predicates can range over very large or even _infinite_ alphabets, like integers. Predicates can be supported by an SMT solver as a plugin.

For an overview of the library please see: [Veanes and Bj√∏rner. *Symbolic Automata: The Toolkit*. In TACAS 2012](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-28756-5_33).
